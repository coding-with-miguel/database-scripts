## In a nutshell

1. We would love to continuously add valuable scripts and queries to this repository.

2. You don't have to know Git. If you find something of interest which is *not already in this repo*, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/linux-league/free-coding-resources/issues) with your links propositions.
    - If you know Git, please Fork the repo and send Pull Requests (PR).


### Formatting

- All lists are `.md` files. Try to learn [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax.
- Sections are using level 3 headings (`###`), and subsections are level 4 headings (`####`).

The idea is to have:

- `2` empty lines between last link and new section.
- `1` empty line between heading & first link of its section.
- `0` empty line between two links.
- `1` empty line at the end of each `.md` file.
